# Epic_FreeGame_Watcher_Discord
A little something made to look after Epic Games' free mystery games. Works on user's demand.


## The hell is this ?

Looks after available free game promotions from the [Epic Game Store](https://www.epicgames.com/store/free-games).

## Setup

1) Go on [Discord's Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers)

2) Make a new application, your choice for the name of the app.

3) On the bot section, create a new bot, named the same if wanted.

4) Create an OAuth token and copy it.

5) Create an OAuth Bot link with the "Read/Send messages" bot permissions, and add it on the server you wanna operate.

5) On the project folder, create an ".env" file with this info :

"TOKEN= thebotstoken"

Save the file, and you're good to go !

6) Open a command line, fire up npm with a npm i, let it do its job, and then type "node index.js". The server should load as said.

## How it works

Simply type "epic.freegame" to get the answer.
